No.
Blonde hair, remember? Glasses? Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?
Riverside Drive.
Right! In fact. No, never mind.
Well, what is it?
Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but. you don't want to go to. that. no.
Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.
What little deal?
I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.
A wedding? Have you lost it, man?
Y'know, my parents are coming in for this.
They're coming in?
Yeah, tomorrow.
Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?
No, no. Still doin' the big sweep across.
Why does he do that?
Doesn't think anyone can tell. So c'mon, do we have a deal?
A wedding?
There's a lot of people to mock.
All right, what the hell.
Great!
When you're dead, you're dead. That's it. You're not goin' anywhere.
C'mon lets go.
Was I supposed to bring something?
You could have.
I met her one time.
It is not necessary.
What did you say then?
Sssshhhhhh!!!
Hi
Hi, Pamela, you remember Jerry.
Yes, we met.
Hi, happy birthday.
Thanks, ah, everybody, this is Elaine and Jerry.
Hi
I didn't bring anything.
Uh, I put you two right here.
Oh, Okay I'm sorry, I didn't know what to bring, nobody told me.
How big a tip do you think it'd take to get him to stop?
I'm in for five.
I'll supply the hat.
Uh-oh. What do we have here?
Why don't you relax and take your jacket off?
Oh, I can't. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly.
How masculine.
Plus I'm wearing short sleeves, I don't want to expose my tattoos. She's unbelievable!
Hey, this guy says he knows Bricker.
Oh, you know Bricker! From where?
What's going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, she's too good to be alone. What's the difference, I can't maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me.
How do you know Pamela?
Uh, friend of a friend. And you?
We went to law school together.
Oh, Jerry!
Oh no, not now.
I had this dream last night and you were in it.
Oh really? Oh God, I gotta get out of this.
You were you, but, you weren't you.
No kidding. Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!
I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window.
This is brutal.
You turned around and you had these wooden teeth.
How do you like that? Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I can't, I can't. I'm stuck.
Jerry? Are you listening to me?
Yes, I heard you.
Elaine, what's the name of that jewelry store you took me to that time?
So, you're a lawyer.
Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit.
Oh, that was you?
Imagine, spelling "Mom" with two O's.
Very funny! What do you do?
Comedian.
Really? That explains it.
Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
Are you ready?
We gotta run. Happy birthday!
I can't believe it. I got nothing! I don't even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen. Sagman. Sag.
That wasn't so bad, really.
Y'know, um, you could use a little work on your manners.
Why? What did I do?
Wel-Well, I just don't appreciate these little courtesy responses, like I'm selling you aluminum siding.
I was listening!
No! You couldn't wait to get back to your little. "conversation".
No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.
Uh-huh.
Where you had, uh, wooden teeth.
No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didn't have wooden teeth, you did!
All right, so I had wooden teeth, so what?
So nothing! Nothing.
Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, "Yeah, I got this new thing: Platonic. My idea, my name, callin' it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- don't do anything, and go right home. What'd you think? I think it's going to be big!" I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didn't work. Y'know, I bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, "Uh, Hi, uh my name's Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, it's a Riconic relationship."
Hey!
Ah, there he is!
This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!
Y'know, Jerry, we don't have to do this.
What are you talkin' about? It's fine, I love having you here.
Tomorrow we'll go to a hotel.
Ma, will you stop?
No, why should we take over your apartment?
I don't care. I'm sleeping next door.
Your friend Kramer doesn't mind?
No, he's making a bouillabaisse.
So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?
Depends on the firm.
Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?
What's the matter? You need a lawyer?
No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I don't know her name.
So why don't you ask someone who was at the party?
Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can't ask her.
Why not?
Because it's complicated. There's some tension there.
He used to go with her.
Which one is she?
From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didn't like.
Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person.
